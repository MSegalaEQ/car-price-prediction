# Car Price Prediction Using Neural Networks
This [Jupyter Notebook](car_price_prediction.ipynb) present a case of data regression in order to predict a specific attribute. The dataset, `cars_train.csv`, is composed by business data related to car sales and the objective is to predict the price attribute based on the remaining features. A simple neural network model was used to fit the data. The methodology used and the results are detailed in the code file. The resulting model was used to predict the dataset in `cars_test.csv`, which is presented in the file `predicted.csv`.
